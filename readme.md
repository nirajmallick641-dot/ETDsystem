  "current": 12.4,
  "meter_id": "MTR-001",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}

Step 3: Configure in Dashboard
Edit Panel → API Configuration
Enter Endpoint: https://your-api.com/api/sensors
Enter API Key: your_secret_key
System auto-connects
Step 4: Monitoring
Toast confirms: "✅ Real API configured!"
Live sensor data updates every 2 seconds
Automatic fallback if API fails
Error Handling

Customization
Modify in JavaScript section:

// Update sensor randomization
sensor1 = 240 + Math.random() * 15;  // 240-255V range
sensor2 = 10 + Math.random() * 8;    // 10-18A range

// Adjust alert frequency
if (Math.random() > 0.85) { /* generate alert */ }

// Change update intervals
setInterval(updateSensorReadings, 2000);    // 2 seconds
setInterval(generateAlert, 8000);           // 8 seconds

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Issue: Music not playing
Check: Browser autoplay settings
Solution: Enable autoplay permissions
Fallback: Use demo mode without music
Issue: API connection fails
Check: API endpoint URL validity
Check: API key correctness
Check: CORS configuration on API
Fallback: System automatically uses demo data
Issue: Alerts not generating
Check: Data limit (999 records max)
Check: Browser console for errors
Solution: Resolve old alerts or clear data
Issue: Dashboard not loading
Check: Internet connection
Check: Browser console for errors
Solution: Refresh page or clear cache
Issue: Real-time updates slow
Check: Browser performance
Check: Network latency
Solution: Close background tabs/applications
📝 Customization Options
Edit Panel Settings
These can be modified without code:

System Name: Change ETDS to your organization name
College Name: Update organization/college name
API Endpoint: Add your hardware sensor API
API Key: Provide authentication token
Code Customization
Modify these in the JavaScript section:

Change alert threshold:

if (Math.random() > 0.85) { /* Lower number = more frequent alerts */ }

Adjust sensor ranges:

sensor1 = 240 + Math.random() * 15;  // Voltage range
sensor2 = 10 + Math.random() * 8;    // Current range

Modify chart refresh rates:

setInterval(updateSensorReadings, 2000);  // 2 seconds

Change colors:

--primary: #00f5ff;    /* Cyan */
--accent: #ff006e;     /* Pink */
--success: #00ff88;    /* Green */

🚢 Deployment
For Production
Set up Real API:
